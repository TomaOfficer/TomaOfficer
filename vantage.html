        <h3>Project Summary</h3>
        <p>
          Vantage is a side project between @<a id="text-link" href="#" target="_blank">Mike Cappucci</a> and myself. We set out to build a tool to help angel investors refine and share their due diligence process so that everyday people could learn how to do it themselves and entrepreneurs could more accurately inhabit the investor's perspective. We believe the time is right for a tool like this as in May 2016 Title III of the JOBS Act (AKA equity crowdfunding) will come into effect allowing anyone to invest in a startup.

        <h4>The Challenge</h4>
        <h3>Create a space for productive criticism</h3>
        <p>Productive criticism is a competitive advantage. Unproductive criticism is a waste of time. Productive criticism requires that you understand what the other side is talking about and that you offer counters that relate to their proposals. Unproductive criticism looks like this:

        <h3>Why are building this?</h3>
        <p>
          Equity crowdfunding is silmutaneously hailed as a "revolution" (source) and derided as a "trap for incompotent, amateur investors" (source). We agree that this is a revolution, and we believe that the only bad investment is where you don't understand
          the risks involved.

        <h3>Research</h3>
        <p>
          People seem to love sharing their ideas online. See reddit. See quora. But the comments that follow a post are, more often than not, a jumbled mess of incoherant back-and-forths. To quote a friend, there are too many controversies and not enough arguments.
          An argument happnes when you criticize another's opinion point for point. A controversy happens when you criticize another's opinion on points that they did not raise. For example, let's say you propose that company X is a viable opportunity
          becuase they've identified a genuine problem, and then I come out and say the company isn't a viable opportunity because the team is worthless. This is a controversy and it's not productive. We could go back-and-forth all day and never really
          get anywhere because we may very well both be right in our independant understanding of what this debate is about. Conversly, an argument can elevate the discipline of entrepreneurship.

        <h3>The Challenge</h3>
        <p>
          How can we get people to write down and share their opinions about early-stage business ideas? How could we facilitate productive critiques about these investment opportunities? And how could we allow entrepreneurs to benefit from these deliberations?

        <h3>Testing assumptions</h3>
        <p>
          We're hoping to get people to write thoughtful, organized opinions about business ideas. We think this is fun and interesting, but seen from another angel this is work. Literally, some people do this for work. Are we sure people are willing to do this
          for free? This assumption had to be addressed before we moved forward, so we created this test.
        </p>
        <img src="images/disco-2.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">
        <p>
          The responses were amazing. People did not think our fake companies were good investment opportunities, and they took the time to tell us why. We considered this a success. Yes, they are people interested in drafting "memos" for the sake of strangers
          about investment opportunities they themselves have no intention of participating in.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the reponses failed to be organized in the structure we presetned the material. Yes, some responses were multiple paragraphs, but were hoping those paragraphs would be organized to mimic the structure of our fake analysis. But this was a secondary
          issue. Now that we've identifed that people are willing to write about companies, we felt we could, through UI constraints, get them to strucuture their writing in a coherant way.

          I started sketching potential solutions. This is the evolution of the primary page in our product, the "arena":

        <h3>Product Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Drawing the "arena" liberated our minds. We finally had a solid understanding of what this product's architecture. I am a big fan of Ryan Singer's approach. No matter what you do, your consumer software product will inevitably take the BREAD strucutre:
          Browse, Read, Edit, Add, and Delete. So we drew up our product components.

          We recruited my father, @ Chuck officer, to help us design a data base schema that connects all these components.

        <h3>UI Mockups</h3>
        <p>
          Now it was time to dive in and dress up our screens. As the database and API was being built, it was my responsibility to nail down the user interface. Here is a shot of the sketch app with mockups in progress:

          We continued to test throughout UI development. Here is an image of me presenting one of our InVision walkthroughs at a tech night demo.

          Through these tests we got to a satisfying place with the mockups. We had developed a simple visual style and completed all of the screens we needed.

        <h3>Retrospective</h3>
        <p>
          This was my first project with Mike. We are startups nerds and, for us, this is the ideal way to start a friendship. That said, there is a lot we could have done better. For example, the personas was a relatively wasted exercise. We ought to have started
          with the "jobs to be done" model.
