        All my projects stem from my passion for exploring, testing, and building new ideas. I'm in awe of our potential. Few things make me happier than getting in sync with a colleague on what that potential looks like. Getting into this mind meld is electrifying and satisfying in its own right. It's also my favorite way to build software.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been designing and building software products for the past 7 years, mostly in startups. In 2016, I was awarded a design fellowship at the Blue Ridge Labs technology incubator. This is where I met my cofounders and launched Afterpattern. Together, over the course of 5 years, we played a critical role in defining a new category of product: no-code app builder for legal professionals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At its peak, when Afterpattern was acquired by NetDocuments, thousands of law firms, courts, and legal aids used our no-code development tools to create award winning legal apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm thankful everyday that it's my job to make ideas real. I love meeting new people who share that passion and know how to get in sync. If you're that kind of person, please reach out at thomas.officer@gmail.com.
