  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    Startup Review is a forum for talking about business ideas. Essentially, this comes down to users writing analysis reports, publishing them on our platform, then upvoting, debating, and critiquing each other in a productive manner. We're developing this now. This write up covers research, prototyping, and mockups.
  </p>
  <p>
    Inasmuch as titles matter, I am the Product Designer and <a href="https://medium.com/@mcapp9" target="_blank">Mike Cappucci</a> is the Product Strategist.

  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>
    In May 2016, Title III of the JOBS Act, AKA investment crowdfunding, is going to become effective. The crowd could play an important role in screening worthwhile investments if the public debate is facilitated properly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Matt Mausner (CEO @<a id="text-link" href="https://woxxer.com/" target="_blank">Woxxer</a>) helped us frame the issue like this: the difference between a productive and unproductive debate is the difference between an argument and a controversy.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Argument</span>: critiquing someone's opinion with a shared understanding of the topic.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Controversy</span>: critiquing someone's opinion without a shared understanding of the topic.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If I say global warming is a fact and you respond that economic development is more important, then we're in a controversy, not an argument. From my perspective, the topic is science; from yours, it's politics. If I say a company is a good investment
    because the team is well balanced, and you respond that it's a poor investment because the business model is unsustainable... well, you get the idea.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, how could we redirect controversies into arguments and focus the crowd's problem-solving ability?
  </p>

  <h1>Research</h1>
  <p>
    First things first, are people even interested in having arguments about business ideas?
  </p>
  <p>
    Reddit, Quora, and Medium show that users are interested in publishing content about business ideas, but they do not show users engaging in arguments. We think this is primarily because the way these sites facilitate comments between users, but maybe it's a motivational issue, i.e. maybe people don't want to have arguments are business ideas.
  </p>
  <p>
    We decided to run a test. We made up a company and wrote up our analysis of it. Then we made some posts to Reddit and Quora with a question geared to generate some responses. (Note: at the time, Startup Review was called Cap/Sure).
  </p>
  <h2 id="sr_h2">Our Post</h2>
  <img src="images/sr_quora.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">
  <p>
    People responded. Not exactly as we hoped (they didn't follow our lead and use headers like The Problem, The Solution, The Team, etc.) but enough to show us that there is a genuine interest in having an argument.
  </p>
  <h2 id="sr_h2">Their Response</h2>
  <img src="images/response.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">

  <h1>Jobs-To-Be-Done</h1>
  <p>
    What job are people accomplishing when they get into these arguments? What goal or outcome are they looking for?
  </p>
  <img src="images/persona.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image">
  <p>
    We think the job is, on a basic level, the joy of participation and the satisfaction of recognition. Our goal is to make our users heroes, to remind them that their input is valuable and to encourage them to share it with others. And becuase the way we'll facilitate that sharing, the outcome will be productive arguments that will elevate the discipline of entrepreneurship.
  </p>

  <h1>Information Architecture</h1>
  <p>
    Users are currently "hiring" other products to achieve their job (e.g. Reddit, Quora, Medium). We studied these products and noticed a pattern: browsing is the primary function. This makes sense because in order to be recognized a user's content must be visible to others. That's why we made the Browse View our hompage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Arena is where the arguments about a business take place. This is the heart of Startup Review and it was the most difficult screen to design. 
  </p>

  <h1>Sketching</h1>
  <p>
    There was a lot of this. We built 3 sets of InVision prototypes, moving from low to higher fidelity.
