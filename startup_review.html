  <h1>Overview</h1>
  <p>
    A platform for organizing and critiquing your opinions about startups. This is important because in May 2016 Title III of the JOBS Act (AKA equity crowdfunding) will come into effect. We want to help create businesses that deserve investment.

  <h1>The Challenge</h1>
  <p>
    Launching a startup means creating something new. Investing in a startup means understanding something new from the outside and, in terms of actually signing an investment agreement, demonstrating value in exchange for equity. For some people, these difficult
    tasks are a rewarding profession. But whether or not you are a professional entrepreneur or investor, your insight is valuable becuase there are no procedures for creating or analyzing something new. Nobody has a corner on certainty in this arena.
    Everybody is a possible source of truth. Granted, some people are more likely to be helpful than others, but this is a skill and it can be learned. A good way to learn is by organizing and critiquing your opinions. The challenge is finding people
    who share your interests, have a different viewpoint, and are able to engage in productive criticism.
  </p>
  <p>
    The difference between productive and unproductive criticism is the difference between an argument and a controversy (credit to Matthew Mausner, CEO <a id="text-link" href="https://woxxer.com/" target="_blank">Woxxer</a>):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span>Argument</span>: critiquing someone's opinion with a shared understanding of the topic at hand.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span>Controversy</span>: critiquing someone's opinion without a shared understanding of the topic at hand.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If I say global warming is a fact and you respond that economic development is more important, then we're in a controversy, not an argument. From my perspective, the topic is science; from yours, it's politics. Similarly, if I say a company is a good investment because the team is perfectly balanced, and you respond that it's not because the business model is unsustainable, then again we're in a controversy. In both instances we are critiquing each other, but in neither are we making any
    progress.
