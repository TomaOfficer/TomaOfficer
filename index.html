      <p>
        Welcome, I'm Thomas "Toma". I build software products remotely from
        Lebanon, NH. I have over 8 years experience in starting companies and
        doing everything required to get a product from zero to 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been working in software startups since I graduated from law school
        and passed the New York bar in 2012. In 2014, I changed careers to be a
        UX designer
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2016, I participated in the Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood tech
        incubator. I met my cofounders and launched Community.lawyer, a lawyer
        referral marketplace. Community.lawyer became the preferred SaaS for bar
        associations across the United States, processing tens of thousands of
        legal assistance requests per month.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of 2017, my cofounders and I launched
        <a href="https://afterpattern.com/" target="_blank">Afterpattern</a>, a
        no-code document automation builder for lawyers. Our goal was to help
        productize legal services to make them more affordable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Afterpattern was acquired by
        <a href="https://www.netdocuments.com/legal-ai/legal-ai" target="_blank"
          >NetDocuments</a
        >
        in 2021. I joined NetDocuments as a product designer and it was here
        that I was when ChatGPT came out. That moment reminded me of when I was
        a young lawyer and I met my first startup; instant recognition that is
        what I should be working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently working on
        <a href="https://www.echonotes.ai/" target="_blank">Echo</a>, a
        note-taking app that's been designed from the ground up for AI. Echo
        helps you capture thoughts more easily with voice notes, and then engage
        and organize those thoughts with AI.
