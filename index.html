      <p>
        I was born in Paris, grew up in New Hampshire. I have an LLB from the University of Edinburgh School of Law and an LLM from Vermont Law School. I started working in design and web development in 2014 while working at my first job out of law school.

        My first job out of law school was for an early-stage, small business called CrowdCheck. It was, and still is, an innovative company trying to leverage technology to deliver a specific legal service at a fraction of the traditional cost.
