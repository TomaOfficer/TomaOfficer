    <p>
      Welcome, I'm Thomas "Toma". I build software products remotely from
      Lebanon, NH. I have over 8 years experience in starting companies and
      doing everything required to get a product from zero to 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been working in software startups since I graduated from law school
      and passed the New York bar in 2012. In 2014, I changed careers to be a UX
      designer
    </p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>Community.lawyer</h3>
    <p>
      In 2016, I participated in the Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood tech
      incubator. I met my cofounders and launched Community.lawyer, a lawyer
      referral marketplace. Community.lawyer became the preferred SaaS for bar
      associations across the United States, processing tens of thousands of
      legal assistance requests per month.
    </p>

    <h3>Afterpattern</h3>
    <p>
      By the end of 2017, my cofounders and I launched
      <a href="https://afterpattern.com/" target="_blank">Afterpattern</a>, a
      no-code document automation builder for lawyers. Our goal was to help
      productize legal services to make them more affordable.
    </p>

    <h3>NetDocuments</h3>
    <p>
      Afterpattern was acquired by
      <a href="https://www.netdocuments.com/legal-ai/legal-ai" target="_blank"
        >NetDocuments</a
      >
      in 2021. I joined NetDocuments as a product designer and it was here that
      I was when ChatGPT came out. That moment reminded me of when I was a young
      lawyer and I met my first startup; instant recognition that is what I
      should be working on.
    </p>

    <h3>Echo</h3>
    <p>
      I'm currently working on
      <a href="https://www.echonotes.ai/" target="_blank">Echo</a>, a
      note-taking app that's been designed from the ground up for AI. Echo helps
      you capture thoughts more easily with voice notes, and then engage and
      organize those thoughts with AI.
