          Hi, I'm Thomas "Toma," a full-stack product designer working remotely
          from New Hampshire. I was born in Paris, grew up in the Upper Valley
          of NH, and went to law school in Scotland. I discovered startups after
          law school and with the help of Venkat Rao's
          <a href="https://breakingsmart.com/en/season-1/" target="_blank"
            >Breaking Smart essays</a
          >, I fell in love with building software.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm currently working on
          <a href="https://www.echonotes.ai/about" target="_blank">Echo</a>
          where my cofounders and I are reimagining the notebook. I'm fascinated
          with the potential of AI as a thinking partner, and it's a pleasure to
          work on unsolved design challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          After 10+ years of working on startups, I've become a software
          entrepreneur generalist with a speciality in rapid UX research and
          detail-obsessed design.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love the woods, walkable cities, and long dinners with friends.
          Quality conversation is a core value. It feels good to be on the same
          page, and even better to feel empowered to act on it. I'm thankful for
          everyone who's allowed me the opportunity to grok, grow, and build
          together.
