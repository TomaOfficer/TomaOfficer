          JP Porchfest is a neighborhood-wide concert that operates like an open studio. Artists perform on porches across Boston's Jamainca Plain neighborhood, for free.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is an effort to build a mobile app to make it easier for participants to choose their own adventure of porches to visit from the schedule of over 125 performances.

          <p>Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed — to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science — and it means
            as little to us (because of our Earthling assumptions) as color means to a blind man.</p>

          I seek to grok collaborative creation. I am captivated by open innovation and online communities. I think there is a hell of a lot of potential in these tools.

          I was born in France, raised in New Hampshire, law school in Scotland, and currently living in Somerville, MA.

          Self-directed.
        </p>
        <p>Early spring 2014, I began my informal design education. I was working on a project with Tim and Chelsea to research and build a for-profit web application called ThroughCompany. I was working as a CrowdCheck analyst and had seen dozens of startups
          launch investment campaigns, reviewing their slide decks, observing how they validated their idea with rapid prototyping and lean analytics. </p>
