      <div class="section">
        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>I am a digital product design student. Currently enrolled at DesignLabs' user interface and branding courses. I am also teaching myself by building and following a reading list (see below) and creating case studies for myself. I have two law degrees,
          one Scotland and the other from Vermont. Immediately after law school, I became a research analyst at a third party-due diligence provider for online investment offerings. I've seen dozens of investment crowdfunding campaings, including reviewing
          business models and financial forecasts.

        <h2>Design Education</h2>
        <p>Early spring 2014, I began my informal design education. I was working on a project with Tim and Chelsea to research and build a for-profit web application called ThroughCompany. I was working as a CrowdCheck analyst and had seen dozens of startups
          launch investment campaigns, reviewing their slide decks, observing how they validated their idea with rapid prototyping and lean analytics. </p>
