              I evaluate how real users experience your product and pinpoint the
              friction that slows them down. You get clear, actionable
              recommendations that make your core flows feel faster, simpler,
              and more obvious.

              <strong>What I focus on:</strong> where people get stuck, what
              they misunderstand, and how to make your product feel effortless.

            <p class="service-card__description">
              I talk directly with your customers so you don't have to guess. A
              short, structured sprint that surfaces the insights your team has
              been missing — how users think, where they struggle, and what
              actually matters to them.
            </p>
            <p class="service-card__focus">
              <strong>The outcome:</strong> crisp, founder-friendly guidance
              rooted in real conversations.

            <p class="service-card__description">
              I help teams map the full journey from first touch to true
              activation — not just where users click, but where they feel the
              “Aha!” that makes your product indispensable. Together, we define
              what an activated user really looks like, identify the moments
              that create that shift, and redesign the experience so more people
              reliably reach it.
            </p>
            <p class="service-card__description">
              From there, I work with you to "close the loop": turning that Aha!
              moment into natural momentum. Whether it's sharing, collaboration,
              templates, content, or internal virality, I help craft the
              simplest path where each activated user attracts the next one.
              This is the core of a product-led growth flywheel — an experience
              that compounds over time instead of depending on brute-force
              marketing.
