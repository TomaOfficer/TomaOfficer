            I'm a product designer and entrepreneur with 10 years experience
            taking products from 0 to 1. I've cofounded multiple startups,
            working across design, engineering, and marketing.
          </p>

          <p>
            I work best with founders and early-stage teams who are looking for
            someone with high agency and can move fast.

        <h3 class="section-header">Usability Audit</h3>
        <p>
          I evaluate how real users experience your product and pinpoint the
          friction that slows them down. You get clear, actionable
          recommendations that make your core flows feel faster, simpler, and
          more obvious.
        </p>

          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Friction Map</p>
            <p class="service__description">
              A visual breakdown of where users get stuck, what confuses them,
              and the specific moments that cause drop-offs in your core flows.

          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Actionable Recommendations</p>
            <p class="service__description">
              Prioritized fixes with clear explanations of what to change, why
              it matters, and how it will improve the user experience.
            </p>

          <li>

        <h3 class="section-header">User Feedback Sprint</h3>
        <p>
          I talk directly with your customers so you don't have to guess. A
          short, structured sprint that surfaces the insights your team has been
          missing — how users think, where they struggle, and what actually
          matters to them.

              organized by themes and patterns that reveal how they actually use
              your product.

          <li>

            <p class="service__description">
              A ranked list of findings that matter most, with clear
              explanations of what users value and what's blocking their
              success.

        <h3 class="section-header">Activation & Flywheel Design</h3>
        <p>
          I help teams map the full journey from first touch to true activation
          — not just where users click, but where they feel the "Aha!" that
          makes your product indispensable. Together, we define what an
          activated user really looks like, identify the moments that create
          that shift, and redesign the experience so more people reliably reach
          it. From there, I work with you to "close the loop": turning that Aha!
          moment into natural momentum where each activated user attracts the
          next one.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Activation Map</p>

          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Aha! Narrative & Redesign Concepts</p>
            <p class="service__description">
              A concise explanation of your true Aha! moment with lightweight
              concepts showing how to guide more users there, faster.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Flywheel Blueprint</p>
            <p class="service__description">
              A simple, visual loop showing how activation leads naturally into
              sharing or inviting, turning each activated user into the next
              source of growth.

        <div class="service__divider"></div>
        <h3 class="section-header">Information Architecture Reset</h3>
        <p>
          I help you revisit your product's navigation structure and underlying
          mental models. Especially useful after years of rapid shipping where
          the product now feels heavier, harder to navigate, and harder to
          evolve.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Information Architecture Map</p>
            <p class="service__description">
              A reorganized structure of your product’s pages, features, flows,
              and concepts that actually matches how your users think.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="service__label">Navigation &amp; Naming System</p>
            <p class="service__description">
              Clear, consistent naming and labeling that reduces mental load and
              makes the product intuitive at a glance.
