        <h3>Usability Audit</h3>
        <p>
          I evaluate how real users experience your product and pinpoint the
          friction that slows them down. You get clear, actionable
          recommendations that make your core flows feel faster, simpler, and
          more obvious.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Friction Map</strong> — A visual breakdown of where users
            get stuck, what confuses them, and the specific moments that cause
            drop-offs in your core flows.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Actionable Recommendations</strong> — Prioritized fixes with
            clear explanations of what to change, why it matters, and how it
            will improve the user experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Usability Report</strong> — A concise document summarizing
            findings, impact, and next steps that your team can reference and
            act on immediately.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>What I focus on:</strong> where people get stuck, what they
          misunderstand, and how to make your product feel effortless.
        </p>

        <h3>User Feedback Sprint</h3>
        <p>
          I talk directly with your customers so you don't have to guess. A
          short, structured sprint that surfaces the insights your team has been
          missing — how users think, where they struggle, and what actually
          matters to them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>User Interview Summary</strong> — Key insights from direct
            conversations with your customers, organized by themes and patterns
            that reveal how they actually use your product.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Prioritized Insights</strong> — A ranked list of findings
            that matter most, with clear explanations of what users value and
            what's blocking their success.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Action Plan</strong> — Concrete next steps based on user
            feedback, with recommendations for what to build, change, or
            investigate further.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The outcome:</strong> crisp, founder-friendly guidance rooted
          in real conversations.
        </p>

        <h3>Activation & Flywheel Design</h3>
        <p>
          I help teams map the full journey from first touch to true activation
          — not just where users click, but where they feel the "Aha!" that
          makes your product indispensable. Together, we define what an
          activated user really looks like, identify the moments that create
          that shift, and redesign the experience so more people reliably reach
          it. From there, I work with you to "close the loop": turning that Aha!
          moment into natural momentum where each activated user attracts the
          next one.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Activation Map</strong> — A clear journey from first touch →
            "Aha!" → activation, highlighting friction, drop-offs, and the
            moments that actually change user behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Aha! Narrative & Redesign Concepts</strong> — A concise
            explanation of your true Aha! moment with lightweight concepts
            showing how to guide more users there, faster.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Flywheel Blueprint</strong> — A simple, visual loop showing
            how activation leads naturally into sharing or inviting, turning
            each activated user into the next source of growth.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>The goal:</strong> help your product create its own momentum.
