          I'm a product designer and entrepreneur with 10 years leading design
          from concept to launch. I recently left my last startup and I'm taking
          on select projects.

          <p class="service-card__description">
            I evaluate how real users experience your product and pinpoint the
            friction that slows them down. You get clear, actionable
            recommendations that make your core flows feel faster, simpler, and
            more obvious.
          </p>
          <p class="service-card__focus">
            <strong>What I focus on:</strong> where people get stuck, what they
            misunderstand, and how to make your product feel effortless.

        <div class="service-card">
          <h4 class="service-card__title">User Feedback Sprint</h4>
          <p class="service-card__description">
            I talk directly with your customers so you don't have to guess. A
            short, structured sprint that surfaces the insights your team has
            been missing — how users think, where they struggle, and what
            actually matters to them.
          </p>
          <p class="service-card__focus">
            <strong>The outcome:</strong> crisp, founder-friendly guidance
            rooted in real conversations.

          <p class="service-card__description">
            I map how users discover value in your product and turn those
            moments into growth loops. This is where activation, delight, and
            natural sharing meet — all designed with a light touch and a clear
            narrative.
