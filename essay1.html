        I'm Thomas ("Toma") Officer. I've been building web products for a little over two years. I'm currently in Brooklyn, NY working on a company I cofounded to help modest-means people find quality, affordable legal help.

        I'm a devouted fan of science fiction. I've always found it entertaining and satisfyingly rich in life lessons. One of my favorites is Neil Stephenson. In Snow Crash he writes, “Until a man is twenty-five, he still thinks, every so often, that under the right circumstances he could be the baddest motherfucker in the world. If I moved to a martial-arts monastery in China and studied real hard for ten years. If my family was wiped out by Colombian drug dealers and I swore myself to revenge. If I got a fatal disease, had one year to live, and devoted it to wiping out street crime. If I just dropped out and devoted my life to being bad.”

        I'm 30 years old. I'm done with this feeling, but I remember it well.
