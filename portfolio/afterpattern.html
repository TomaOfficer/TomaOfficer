          In 2017, as Fellows at the Blue Ridge Labs tech incubator, two insights were shaping our perspective on the consumer legal marketplace. First, it seemed universally agreed upon by modest means New Yorkers that “lawyers are for rich people.” Second, web apps like TurboTax and LegalZoom were offering quasi legal services at scale at affordable prices. 
        </p>
        <p>
          If LegalZoom extended its product offerings to include the types of services modest means New Yorkers need from an attorney, they’d make a killing and do some good. The problem is, LegalZoom isn’t a law firm. Their products can't provide legal advice, only legal information. They're great if you need to incorporate an LLC ($79) or create a basic will ($89), but you're not going to LegalZoom for your eviction case.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if the deep expertise of law firms could be merged with the efficiency of tech companies like LegalZoom? What if legal professionals could convert their expensive knowledge into affordable, accessible, and still personalized software products?
        </p>
        <p>
          What if there was a no-code app builder designed specifically for legal professionals?

          Before it was acquired by NetDocuments in November 2021, Afterpattern was the preferred app development tool for some of the most innovative legal professionals in the United States. These apps not only won national and regional awards, they helped more than 500,000 people access a wide range of traditionally expensive legal services; everything from opting into the CDC's eviction moratorium to keep tenants in their home during the COVID pandemic to understanding whether the Trump administration's "Muslim travel ban" applied to them (and what to do about it if it did).

          One of our biggest challenges was that Afterpattern was a new category of product. We couldn't approach law firms and say "you know that thing you do all the time? We help you do it faster/cheaper/easier." Our customers had never built legal apps before. Before we could train them how to do it (with our Afterpattern University, which I poured countless hours into), we had to convince them why they should do it.

            Expanding upon the novelty of Afterpattern and its inherent challenges necessitated a significant shift in our marketing strategy and overall business approach. Instead of promoting an enhanced method of conducting familiar tasks, we found ourselves standing on the precipice of a unique paradigm, tasked with selling a revolution rather than an evolution in legal practices. Indeed, the introduction of legal apps, an entirely new concept to our potential clients, required more than just the promise of speed or cost-efficiency. It was the pursuit of an untapped avenue of opportunity, a futuristic leap into a world where law and technology coalesce.
          </li>
          <li>
            To break through the inertia of traditional legal practices, we needed to articulate a compelling vision of the future, where these legal apps weren't just theoretical propositions, but practical tools integrated into their day-to-day operations. This vision had to showcase not just the ‘how,’ but more importantly, the ‘why’ – why these legal apps would redefine their operations and how this unprecedented approach to law could ultimately enhance their efficiency and competitive edge. The task was far from simple, but it was in the creation of Afterpattern University where this challenge met its answer.
          </li>
          <li>
            I dedicated an immeasurable amount of time to the conception and development of Afterpattern University. It became not only a platform to provide the technical know-how, but also a stage to emphasize the potential benefits and capabilities of legal apps. Through comprehensive training modules and practical examples, we slowly but surely managed to unravel the new language of legal tech to our clients. We equipped them with the knowledge and understanding to see beyond the customary, to envision a future where they were not just lawyers, but innovators in their field. The task was as exhausting as it was exhilarating, but every milestone was a step towards transforming the legal landscape.

          As we close this narrative, it's crucial to highlight the transformative journey that Afterpattern has undergone. Not only did it introduce a groundbreaking concept into the legal industry, but it also trailblazed a pathway for legal professionals to democratize their expert knowledge via accessible, affordable software applications. By breaking down barriers and innovating a completely new category, we offered a fresh perspective on what legal services could be. Indeed, our customers had never built legal apps before, and convincing them of this new approach was no small task. But through diligent effort, educational initiatives, and relentless perseverance, we bridged the gap between law firms and software efficiency. Today, as part of the NetDocuments family, Afterpattern continues to revolutionize legal services, maintaining its commitment to making the law understandable, affordable, and within reach for all. Through our journey, we proved that the synthesis of legal expertise and tech efficiency is not just a "what if" – it's a reality, a vibrant and powerful force reshaping the landscape of the legal services market.
