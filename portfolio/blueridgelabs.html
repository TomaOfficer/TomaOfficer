          I stumbled upon Blue Ridge Labs with only 24 hours remaining before their Fellowship deadline closed. The Fellowship is a 5 month program to help entrepreneurs find cofounders, build prototypes, and raise money. The purpose is to create new ventures that tackle the target challenge of the year. In 2016, the target challenge was the justice gap: the staggering difference between the need for, and the availability of, affordable legal services.
        </p>
        <p>
          I lived in Boston in 2016. The Fellowship took place in Brooklyn. Nevertheless, I applied. One of the easiest choices I've ever made.

          What is it like to spend 5 months with talented strangers, surrounded by whiteboards, bashing your head against a problem? That deserves its own blog post. For now, let me say that it was chaos. Beautiful, exciting, frustrating, and ultimately productive chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          My cofounders and I focused on the problem of finding an affordable lawyer once you've discovered that you're "over income" and therefore don't qualify for legal aid. We called it Community.lawyer.

          Afterpattern allows legal professionals to transform their expertise into software, what we call legal apps. When it was acquired in November 2021, thousands of law firms, courts, and legal aids used Afterpattern to build game-changing, and occasionally award-winning, legal apps.
