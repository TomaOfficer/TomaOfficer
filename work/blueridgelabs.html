## Overview

Blue Ridge Labs is a 5-month program to help entrepreneurs find cofounders, build prototypes, and raise money. In 2016, the target challenge was the justice gap: the staggering difference between the need for, and the availability of, affordable legal services. This is where I found my cofounders and built the first version of Community.lawyer.

**Highlight:** Built a referral network still used by 20,000+ people monthly to find legal help.

## Goals

1. **Find affordable lawyers.** Help people who are "over income" for legal aid but can't afford traditional legal services find affordable representation.

2. **Build a two-sided marketplace.** Connect clients seeking legal help with lawyers who can provide services at accessible price points.

3. **Modernize lawyer referral services.** Transform outdated phone-based bar association referral services into modern web experiences.

## The Challenge
