          with only 24 hours remaining before their Fellowship deadline closed.
          The Fellowship is a 5 month program to help entrepreneurs find
          cofounders, build prototypes, and raise money. The purpose is to
          create new ventures that tackle the target challenge of the year. In
          2016, the target challenge was the justice gap: the staggering
          difference between the need for, and the availability of, affordable
          legal services.

          What is it like to spend 5 months with talented strangers, surrounded
          by whiteboards, bashing your head against a problem? That deserves its
          own blog post. For now, let me say that it was chaos. Beautiful,
          exciting, frustrating, and ultimately productive chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          My cofounders and I focused on the problem of finding an affordable
          lawyer once you've discovered that you're "over income" and therefore
          don't qualify for legal aid. We called it Community.lawyer.

          Community.lawyer was a two-sided marketplace, with clients on one side
          and lawyers on the other. Where would we get our roster of lawyers?
          What hack could we exploit to get a large roster of vetted lawyers
          with as little effort as possible?
        </p>
        <p>
          Our first pivot was moving away from trying to build our own roster of
          lawyers towards partnering with those organizations that already had
          them: bar associations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bar associations have lawyer referral services that traditionally
          operate by phone. Their online experience was outdated. We offered
          Community.lawyer as referral platform SaaS.

          We grew very quickly to include as customers some of the largest bar
          associations in the country. Our network of referral platforms still
          exists today and is used by over 20,000 people every month to find
          legal help.
