A no-code app builder designed specifically for legal professionals.

## Role
Cofounder, 2016-2021

## Team
3 cofounders + contractors

## Platforms
Web App

## Overview

Afterpattern was a no-code platform that enabled lawyers to build software applications. We merged the deep expertise of law firms with the efficiency of tech companies like LegalZoom, allowing legal professionals to convert their expensive knowledge into affordable, accessible, and personalized software products.

**Highlight:** Acquired by NetDocuments in 2021 after helping 500,000+ people access legal services.

## Goals

1. **Bridge the justice gap.** Make legal services accessible to modest means Americans who can't afford traditional lawyers but don't qualify for legal aid.

2. **Empower lawyers to build software.** Give legal professionals the tools to transform their expertise into scalable applications without needing to code.

3. **Create a new category.** Introduce the concept of lawyer-built legal apps to an industry that had never considered it possible.

## Origin

In 2017, as Fellows at the Blue Ridge Labs tech incubator, two insights shaped our perspective. First, modest means New Yorkers universally agreed that "lawyers are for rich people." Second, web apps like TurboTax and LegalZoom were offering quasi legal services at scale at affordable prices.

What if the deep expertise of law firms could be merged with the efficiency of tech companies? What if there was a no-code app builder designed specifically for legal professionals?

## Product Suite

We didn't start by building a no-code app builder. We started by observing tech-savvy, entrepreneurial lawyers using Docassemble, an open-source expert system. In 2017, we launched The Docassemble Toolkit. By 2018, we had the confidence to launch our own no-code app builder.
