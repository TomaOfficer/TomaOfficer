          <p>
            In 2017, as Fellows at the
            <a href="https://www.labs.robinhood.org/" target="_blank"
              >Blue Ridge Labs tech incubator</a
            >, two insights were shaping our perspective on the consumer legal
            marketplace. First, it seemed universally agreed upon by modest
            means New Yorkers that "lawyers are for rich people." Second, web
            apps like TurboTax and LegalZoom were offering quasi legal services
            at scale at affordable prices.
          </p>
          <p>
            If LegalZoom extended its product offerings to include the types of
            services modest means New Yorkers need from an attorney, they'd make
            a killing and do some good. The problem is, LegalZoom isn't a law
            firm. Their products can't provide legal advice, only legal
            information. They're great if you need to incorporate an LLC ($79)
            or create a basic will ($89), but you're not going to LegalZoom for
            your eviction case.
          </p>
          <p>
            What if the deep expertise of law firms could be merged with the
            efficiency of tech companies like LegalZoom? What if legal
            professionals could convert their expensive knowledge into
            affordable, accessible, and still personalized software products?
          </p>
          <p>
            What if there was a no-code app builder designed specifically for
            legal professionals?

            The App Builder was the cornerstone of our multi-product suite of
            no-code tools.
          </h3>
          <p>
            We didn't start by building a no-code app builder. We started by
            observing tech-savvy, entrepreneurial, hacker-type lawyers. In 2017,
            these lawyers were using
            <a href="https://docassemble.org/" target="_blank">Docassemble</a>,
            an open-source expert system, to create apps that automated
            documents. That same year, we launched our first product, The
            Docassemble Toolkit, a developer tool for deploying and hosting
            Docassemble.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 2018, we had the confidence to launch our own no-code app
            builder, which was essentially a GUI on top of Docassemble.
          </p>
          <p>
            From 2019 - 2021, we dramatically expanded the feature functionality
            of our app builder, while relying primarily on frontend, UI
            enhancements to address usability issues.
          </p>

            in November 2021, Afterpattern was the preferred app development
            tool for some of the most innovative legal professionals in the
            United States. These apps not only won national and regional awards,
            they helped more than 500,000 people access a wide range of
            traditionally expensive legal services. This included everything
            from keeping tenants in their home during the COVID pandemic to
            helping immigrants negotiate the Trump's administration's "Muslim
            travel ban."

            By 2021, Afterpattern offered a full suite of no-code development
            products, including:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An airtable-like database that allows you to save, and more
              importantly re-use, the information collected by your apps.
            </li>
            <li>
              A document template editor that allows you to define precise rules
              for customizing the underlying document.
            </li>
            <li>
              The ability to use your database as the backend of a custom web
              portal that you can use to create protected client accounts for
              sharing and collecting information.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            One of our biggest challenges was that Afterpattern was a new
            category of product. We couldn't approach law firms and say "you
            know that thing you do all the time? We can help you do it
            faster/cheaper/easier." Our customers had never built legal apps
            before. Before we could train them how to do it, we had to convince
            them why they should.

            To break through beyond early-adopters, we needed to articulate a
            compelling vision for the future of legal services. We found
            traction in framing Afterpattern as the solution to the problem of
            the "missing middle" of the consumer legal market, i.e. why aren't
            everyday Americans buying legal services for the multiple legal
            issues they experience each year?
          </p>
          <p>
            Once we had a lawyer's attention, we had to teach them how to not
            only use our app builder but, perhaps more importantly, how to think
            like a software engineer and recognize how to break down a legal
            service into discrete parts that can be automated. This task was not
            simple, but it was in the creation of Afterpattern University where
            this challenge met its answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I dedicated an immeasurable amount of time to the conception and
            development of Afterpattern University. It became not only a
            platform to provide the technical know-how, but also a stage to
            emphasize the potential benefits and capabilities of legal apps.
          </p>
          <p>
            Afterpattern helped introduce a groundbreaking concept to the legal
            industry: that lawyers are willing and able to transform their
            expertise into software applications. By breaking down barriers and
            innovating a completely new category, we offered a fresh perspective
            on what legal services could be. Our customers had never built legal
            apps before, and convincing them of this new approach was no small
            task. But through diligent effort, educational initiatives, and
            relentless perseverance, we bridged the gap between law firms and
            software efficiency.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today, as part of NetDocuments, Afterpattern continues to
            revolutionize legal services, maintaining its commitment to making
            the law understandable, affordable, and within reach for all.
