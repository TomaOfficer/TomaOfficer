              I'm a designer with 10 years experience working in various roles for various startups. My first job out of law school was for a tech company that only hired lawyers in case it turned out its software constituted the delivery of legal services. This was my introduction to the world of software design and I haven't looked back since.

            <p>
              I've had the great priviledge of a wandering career. I studied religion in college and went to law school in Scotland. I discovered tech entrepreneurship when I was 25 and spent 2 years transitioning from lawyer to UX designer and then front-end developer. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The pivotal moment of my career was joining the Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood tech incubator as a Design Fellow in 2016. This is where I met my cofounders who I would work with for the next 5 years. We built Afterpattern, a no-code automation builder for lawyers. Afterpattern was acquired by NetDocuments in 2021.
