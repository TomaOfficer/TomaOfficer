            I'm a Design Fellow at Blue Ridge Labs @ Robin Hood, an incubator program for social enterprise tech companies. Our specific mandate, as the class of 2016, is to create a product/service to improve equal access to the civil legal system.

            I was a Product Designer at <a class="subtle" href="#">FoundationLab</a>, a strategy/design/development firm based out of Boston, MA.

          <li>
            I was a Research Analyst at <a class="subtle" href="#">CrowdCheck</a>, a due diligence and disclosure platform for investment crowdfunding portals. With less jargon: I helped companies organize the disclosures required for an online investment campaign.

            I graduated from Vermont Law School with an LLM in Amercian Legal Studies. This complimented my LLB from the University of Edinburgh and allowed me to join the New York Bar Association.
