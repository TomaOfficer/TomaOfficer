          Introduction:
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a software product designer with over eight years of experience, primarily in the startup world, I’ve
          witnessed firsthand the transformative power of design. The role of a designer is to create meaningful
          experiences that not only solve problems but also inspire and engage users. Recently, I decided to embark on a
          personal journey to redesign my portfolio website, moving away from no-code tools like Webflow in favor of a
          hand-crafted approach. In this blog post, I’ll share my motivations for the redesign, the benefits I
          anticipate, and some of the challenges I’ve encountered along the way.
        </p>
        <h4>Embracing Growth and Adaptability:</h4>
        <p>
          The technology landscape is ever-evolving, and as a designer, it’s essential to keep pace with the changes.
          Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in various domains, from user experience design to product management.
          Redesigning my portfolio presents an opportunity to showcase my growth and adaptability, while also
          demonstrating my ability to learn and apply new tools, frameworks, and methodologies.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Showcasing Personal Brand:
        </h4>
        <p>
          No-code tools like Webflow have democratized web design, allowing even non-technical individuals to create
          visually stunning websites. However, as a professional designer, I recognize the value of a unique personal
          brand. By building my portfolio from scratch, I can craft a one-of-a-kind experience that reflects my identity
          and design philosophy, making it easier for potential clients and employers to see what sets me apart.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Demonstrating Technical Prowess:
        </h4>
        <p>
          While no-code tools are fantastic, they can sometimes limit the scope of what's possible. By building my
          portfolio by hand, I can fully leverage my technical expertise, showcase my coding abilities, and create
          highly customized interactions and animations. This not only demonstrates my aptitude as a designer but also
          proves my proficiency in bridging the gap between design and development.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Reflection and Continuous Improvement:
        </h4>
        <p>
          Redesigning my portfolio has given me the opportunity to reflect on my past work and identify areas for
          improvement. By revisiting and reevaluating my previous projects, I can apply fresh perspectives and lessons
          learned to enhance my designs further. This iterative process exemplifies the spirit of continuous improvement
          that is so vital in the design industry.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Future-Proofing:
        </h4>
        <p>
          Building my portfolio from scratch allows me to take advantage of cutting-edge web technologies and best
          practices. By incorporating responsive design, performance optimizations, and accessibility features, I ensure
          that my portfolio remains relevant and usable for years to come.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Conclusion:
        </h3>
        <p>
          Redesigning my portfolio has been a journey of growth, self-discovery, and an opportunity to refine my
          personal brand. As I transition from no-code tools to a hand-crafted approach, I look forward to the
          challenges that lie ahead, and the lessons I’ll learn as I continue to develop as a designer. I’m excited to
          share this new chapter of my career with you, and I hope my experiences inspire you to embark on your own
          journey of growth and self-improvement.
