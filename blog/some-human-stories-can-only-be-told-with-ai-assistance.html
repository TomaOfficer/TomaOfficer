            There's a difference between AI-assistance and AI-generation, and
            the former may usher in a new golden age of blogging.

            alt="Me, Thomas, recording a voice note"
          />
          <p>This story began as a voice note.</p>
          <p>
            That picture above is really me, but the voice note that started
            this story wasn't captured sitting down. My favorite way to
            kickstart a writing project is with a walk; letting myself ramble as
            I ramble.
          </p>
          <p>
            I consider myself creative, but something about staring at a blank
            page makes me freeze. However, let me walk and talk and my
            creativity builds up speed, like a round rock given a nudge past the
            apex of a hill.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm not saying my writing is any good — I probably alliterate too
            much — but I am saying that my writing is worthwhile.
          </p>
          <p>So is yours.</p>
          <p>So is everyone else's.</p>
          <p>
            I'll cut to the chase because I suspect you can already tell where
            this is going: AI is good for writing because it creates more
            writers.
          </p>
          <p>To be clear, I don't consider this writing:</p>
          <img
            src="../assets/blog/chatgptwriting.png"
            alt="Writing generated by ChatGPT"
          />
          <p>
            Writing is composing text. Asking ChatGPT to write a blog post will
            generate some text, but it isn't writing. I don't think you'll
            disagree.
          </p>
          <p>
            But do you also agree that there's a difference between
            AI-assistance and AI-generation?
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe there's a version of the near future where AI-assisted
            writing ushers in a new golden age of blogging, simply because a new
            cohort of writers enter the scene. Writers like me, who love to
            read, want to participate, but need all the help they can get to
            arrive at the page ready to write.
          </p>
          <p>
            What does AI-assisted writing look like? YMMV, but for me it looks
            like this:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              AI makes voice notes actually useful, not only through
              high-fidelity transcription but also by keeping transcripts
              organized (an underappreciated consequence of voice notes is that
              it creates a mess of text that can't be put to practical use
              without some organization — AI is excellent for automatic,
              semantic organization of my notes).
            </li>
            <li>
              AI helps me develop topics by asking questions, pushing me to
              think deeper. Sometimes, rambling monologues unlock my creativity,
              but sometimes what I need is for someone to interview me.
            </li>
            <li>
              AI helps me trigger self-inspired Aha! moments, not by feeding me
              ideas but as an interface to my increasingly deep library of
              captured thoughts. Imagine me browsing a newspaper-style interface
              where each "article" is a remixed and resurrected version of a
              thought I had previously captured.
            </li>
            <li>Finally, AI helps me shape my thoughts into an outline.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Maybe that's a bit dramatic. How did Tony Stubblebine , CEO of
            Medium, put it?

            AI translations, spell-checks, and note-taking help people tell
            their stories. But the spectrum veers into a gray area as AI
            contributes outlines, research, and even partial sections.

          </p>
          <p>
            I agree; using AI to create an outline is a gray area. But like all
            things in the gray area, the virtue of using AI like this is a
            matter of nuance. How you use AI to create an outline makes all the
            difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            The outline for this blog post was created by AI. But before you
            judge me, consider what I contributed and how I used AI to shape my
            contributions into an outline.
          </p>
          <p>I contributed 3 voice notes and the thesis.</p>
          <p>
            My thesis: If it's true that this blog post wouldn't exist without
            AI, and if it's true that this blog post is fundamentally human,
            then it's true that some human stories wouldn't exist without AI
            assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            My voice notes are rambling monologues that danced around this
            thesis. There is a lot of cruft in those voice notes. A lot was cut
            to produce the outline I'm looking at right now. AI took my thesis
            and rough thoughts and shaped it into a coherent outline, but AI did
            not contribute a single idea or turn of phrase.
          </p>
          <p>That's the difference between AI-assistance and AI-generation.</p>
          <p>So, tell me, is this story human?</p>
