        <p>
          Either all at once or gradually over the past 50 years, we've entered the world of AI experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been playing around with some of these AI tools and I'm fascinated. Like many others, I've learned how to get more useful responses out of large language models. The trick is framing your question properly and providing enough context. If I'm asking, "why is my code not working?" my codebase is the necessary context. If I'm asking, "should I take this job?" the context includes the job listing, my work experience, professional goals, and on and on.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm frustrated by the experience of manually providing my context to an AI experience like ChatGPT. Every time I want to have a productive AI conversation, I re-enter the paragraphs of information that define my context.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm going to build something for this problem. Something with public services and small businesses in mind. Something that allows them to invite their audiences to provide whatever context is needed to deliver a useful AI experience.

        <!-- <h1>AI context as a service</h1>
        <p>July 2023</p>
        <p>
          AI has recently become one of the most powerful and affordable resources available to businesses of all sizes. We live in a world of ai experiences where a consumer's unique context can be used to make the generic personal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A job board that helps job seekers perform a gap analysis between their resume and the requirements of their ideal job.
          </li>
          <li>
            A travel guide that provides itineraries tailored to each tourist.
          </li>
          <li>
            A textbook publisher that uses each studentâ€™s unique learning style to reformat educational content to fit their needs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this new world, one-size-fits-all content is intolerable. Everyone is different, so why would everyone consume the exact same presentation of a job post, travel guide, or text book?
        </p>
        <h3>There'll be winners and losers</h3>
        <p>
          Businesses that continue to use consumer data only for advertisement will fall behind those that use consumer data to define contexts and build AI experiences that create personalized interfaces to their products and services.
