        <h1>AI context as a service</h1>
        <p>July 2023</p>
        <p>
          AI has recently become one of the most powerful and affordable resources available to businesses of all sizes. We live in a world of ai experiences where a consumer's unique context can be used to make the generic personal. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A job board that helps job seekers perform a gap analysis between their resume and the requirements of their ideal job.
          </li>
          <li>
            A travel guide that provides itineraries tailored to each tourist.
          </li>
          <li>
            A textbook publisher that uses each studentâ€™s unique learning style to reformat educational content to fit their needs.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In this new world, one-size-fits-all content is intolerable. Everyone is different, so why would everyone consume the exact same presentation of a job post, travel guide, or text book?
        </p>
        <h3>There'll be winners and losers</h3>
        <p>
          Businesses that continue to use consumer data only for advertisement will fall behind those that use consumer data to define contexts and build AI experiences that create personalized interfaces to their products and services.
